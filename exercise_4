2. Cleaned social_register_1918 with Regular Expression deleting line breaks where not useful. Used ([a-z]) ?\n(?=[a-z]) to find them and $1(space) to replace it. The objective is to create a list of names as close as possible to a modern address record.

The text presents also a <0x0c> expression which I tried to clean but I found it quite hard, mostly because the RegEx was not finding it automatically
Due to the highly irregularities in the text the refining process may take some extra manual cleaning. The initial stage of cleaning took around 4-5 hours due to inexperience and multiple experiments with RegEx.
