My goal for this material would be to compare the different years, especially 1918 and 1919, to understand how the Spanish Flu pandemic and the global depression after the Great War impacted the possessions of New York City residents, as well as their ability to move for the summer season. I believe it will take a further research into the other registers of New York City. Some lines of the summer registers report the death of the residence owner, so I find very interesting inquire in those two years, spectators of one of the hardest times the world has ever experienced.

<p> Updates: 
<br>
1. 1/23/2021: Isolated the two .txt files on GitHub for research purposes (2hrs.)
<br>
2. 2/1/2021: Starting to clean the Social Register, Summer 1918 (5 hrs.) 
<br>
3. 2/9/2021: After consulting with Dr. Hanley, I procedeed cleaning the .txt file social_register_1918 (2 hrs.) 
<br>
4. 2/15/2021: During the weekend I found the key to work with the social registers: due to the size and the amount of raw data present in the text, working on samples to understand how it may work on the complete document and, then, work piece by piece to reproduce the steps done on the sample. At the moment, the file social_register_1918 has been partially cleaned, the first two pages has been transformed in .csv files with OpenRefine, and imported in Google Data Studio to produce the first round of data. (weekend work: 5 hrs. - Monday work: 1 hr.) Link to the report: https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/a9322446-e234-40d3-b702-8c36c47dc023 </p>
